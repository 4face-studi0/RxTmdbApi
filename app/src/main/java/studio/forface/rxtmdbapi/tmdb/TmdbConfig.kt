     * Get the system wide configuration information. Some elements of the API require some
     * knowledge of this configuration data. The purpose of this is to try and keep the actual API
     * responses as light as possible. It is recommended you cache this data within your
     * application and check for updates every few days.
     *
     * This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change
     * key map.
     *
     * To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url, size and file_path.
     * Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL. Hereâ€™s an example URL:
     * https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg
     *
     * You can also use built-in tools like:
     * @see ImagesConfig.bestSizeUrl or
     * @see mapToSizedUrls or
     * @see Image.getSizedUrl
     * using [ImageType].
     *
     * The configuration method also contains the list of change keys which can be useful if you
     * are building an app that consumes data from the change feed.
